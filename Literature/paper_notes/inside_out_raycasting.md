# [Inside-out Tracking Controller for VR/AR HMD using Image Recognition with Smartphones](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3388770.3407430)

## Year
Auguet 2020

## TL;DR
A VR/AR raycasting system using image recognition from smartphone's camera. This can detect 6DoF and perform raycasting even when the controller is in an occluded spot.

## Overall Impression
An easy to read and understand paper. The smartphone could detect its own position even outside the detect range of the HMD. Frameworks like VRySmart was built from this feature for SLAM-based tracking.
