# [A Hybrid 2D-3D Tangible Interface for Virtual Reality](https://doi.org/10.1145/3450618.3469166)

_August 2021_

tl;dr: A novel input method for a hybird 2D-3D tangible VR interface, combining a smartphone and a VR controller.

#### Overall Impression
Interesting idea. I intend to use a smartphone as a controller for writting in virtual 3D space. This article is a good start.
#### Key Points
* Many controllers use outside-in tracking for HMDs
* An inside-out tracking, which can detect 6DoF, is studied.

#### Technical details
- Summary of technical details/methodology

#### Notes
- Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work
